This is a test pet-project on the theme "Application for managing the work of the library."

Implemented all the necessary functionality for the library to work:

1. An unauthorized user can see the list of books, whether the book is available, and he also has the opportunity to get the most popular and not popular book.

2. The same can be done by an authorized user, and also make a request for a specific book. He can view a list of all requests with detailed statistics in his profile.

3. The manager can view all requests, as well as respond to the book request, that is, give the book to the user or refuse.

Technology stack:

1. Java Core (version 17)
2. Spring Framework
3. PostgreSQL
4. Hibernate 5
5. Thymeleaf
6. Bootstrap
